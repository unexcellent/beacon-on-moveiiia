"""HIL test: the thermal camera's image survives the SSTV round-trip over I2S.

Mirror of the RGB test for the MI48Dx thermal camera. The ESP encodes the thermal
frame as Robot36 audio; we capture it off the Pi's I2S slave input, decode it, and
check it looks like a real frame.

Requires:
  - ESP running firmware with the RGB camera disabled, thermal enabled:
        cargo build --release --features no-rgb-camera   (flash / OTA it)
    so the SSTV downlink is a single 320x240 thermal frame.
  - The thermal camera connected and working, pointed at a scene with some
    temperature contrast (e.g. a hand / warm object) so the frame isn't flat.
  - I2S capture on the Pi as an ALSA card named 'esp-i2s' (see hosts/odin nix).
  - `arecord` (alsa-utils) and the `sstv` Python package (pip install sstv).

The thermal frame is rendered grayscale (src/camera/sensors/mi48.rs: R=G=B), so
it is lower-contrast than a photo — min_std is a bit lower and may need tuning
once a real thermal capture is available.

Skips cleanly (exit 77) when the capture card / arecord is missing.
