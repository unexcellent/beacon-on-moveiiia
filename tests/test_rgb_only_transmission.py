"""HIL test: the RGB camera's image survives the SSTV round-trip over I2S.

The ESP encodes the RGB frame as Robot36 audio; we capture it off the Pi's I2S
slave input, decode it, and check it looks like a real picture.

Requires:
  - ESP running firmware with the thermal camera disabled, RGB enabled:
        cargo build --release --features no-thermal-camera   (flash / OTA it)
    so the SSTV downlink is a single 320x240 RGB frame.
  - The RGB camera connected and working.
  - I2S capture on the Pi as an ALSA card named 'esp-i2s' (see hosts/odin nix).
  - `arecord` (alsa-utils) and the `sstv` Python package (pip install sstv).

Skips cleanly (exit 77) when the capture card / arecord is missing.
